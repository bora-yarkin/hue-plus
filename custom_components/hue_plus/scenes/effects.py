"""What a scene shows: where the colours come from, and how the brightness moves.

Free of Home Assistant. A colour source gives the colour of each light at a moment; brightness effects (pulse, flicker, sparkle,
lightning) then dim or brighten it. All of it is a pure function of the light and the time played, so the same input always gives
the same result, also for the effects that look random (they use a fixed hash, not a random generator). The engine decides
when to send and how; this module only says what.
